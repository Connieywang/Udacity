# Investigate a Dataset

## Summary

In this project, we will conduct our own data analysis and create a file to share that documents our finding. I chose the data form the Movie Databse(TMDb). It has information about 10,000 movies, which includes user ratings and revenue. Also, it provides different categories, such as runtime, director, production companies, release year etc.

## Prerequistes

You will need : Pandas, numpy, random, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn

CSV file : tmdb-movies.csv

#### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

1. Investigate data and clean dataset 
2. Drop unuseful data and duplicated rows to get more accurate answers
3. Find the statistics of the dataframe
4. Clean zero values if it is necessary
